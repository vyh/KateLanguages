# Kate Language File(s)

Currently contains a single syntax highlighting definition useable in Kate, for the LC4 assembly language used in computer science courses at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Installing

To install a Kate highlighting file, you should just need to drop the file in the right directory. For my version (3.8.5) of the editor, this was ~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax.

If that directory does not yet exist, try updating your highlighting files:

    1. Go to Settings > Configure Kate... > Open/Save > Modes & Filetypes
    2. Click Download Highlighting Files...
    3. Click install

This should download updates to known highlighting files and create the katepart/syntax directory if it didn't exist.
